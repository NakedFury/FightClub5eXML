				<text>You can quickly survey the battlefield and devise a plan of action to defeat your enemies. You can take a bonus action to issue battlefield commands to friendly creatures within 30 feet of you that can hear you.

Once you issue these commands, you cannot do so again until you fnish a short or long rest.</text>
				<text>Each command issued grants the creature a bonus die, which is a d4. When the creature would make an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, the creature can expend the die by rolling it and adding the number rolled to the total. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Battle Command die, but must decide before the GM reveals whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once expended, the bonus die is lost.</text>
				<text>When you reach certain levels in this class, the bonus die changes. The die becomes a d6 at 5th level, a d8 at 9th level, a d10 at 13th level, and a d12 at 17th level.</text>
